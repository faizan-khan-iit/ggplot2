#' Histograms and frequency polygons.
#'
#' Display a 1d distribution by dividing into bins and counting the number
#' of observations in each bin. Histograms use bars; frequency polygons use
#' lines.
#'
#' By default, \code{stat_bin} uses 30 bins - this is not a good default,
#' but the idea is to get you experimenting with different binwidths. You
#' may need to look at a few to uncover the full story behind your data.
#'
#' @section Aesthetics:
#' \code{geom_histogram} uses the same aesthetics as \code{geom_bar};
#' \code{geom_freqpoly} uses the same aesthetics as \code{geom_line}.
#'
#' @export
#' @inheritParams layer
#' @inheritParams geom_point
#' @param geom,stat Use to override the default connection between
#'   \code{geom_histogram}/\code{geom_freqpoly} and \code{stat_bin}.

#' # Often we don't want the height of the bar to represent the
#' # count of observations, but the sum of some other variable.
#' # For example, the following plot shows the number of movies
#' # in each rating.
#' m <- a_plot(movies, aes(rating))
#' m + geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)
#'
#' # If, however, we want to see the number of votes cast in each

#'
#' # For transformed coordinate systems, the binwidth applies to the
#' # raw data. The bins have constant width on the original a_scale.
#'
#' # Using log scales does not work here, because the first
#' # bar is anchored at zero, and so whens transformed becomes negative
#' # infinity. This is not a problem when transforming the scales, because
#' # no observations have 0 ratings.

#' m + geom_histogram(origin = 0) + ggplot2Animint:::a_coord_trans(x = "sqrt")

#' # You can also transform the y axis.  Remember that the base of the bars
#' # has value 0, so log transformations are not appropriate
